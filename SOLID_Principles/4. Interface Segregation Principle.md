### Definition
Interfaces should be such that client should not be forced to implement unnecessary functions.

### Problem Statement
Suppose there is a requirement to create an application which has list of employees with their designations. Available designations in the company are Developer, QA Engineer, Manager and DevOps Engineer.

### Naive Approach
Create an interface having contract that need to be implemented by all employees.
```java
interface Employee{
	void develop();
	void testApp();
	void deploy();
	void manageTeam();
}
```

Developers defines their job.
```java
class Developer implements Employee{

	@Override
	public void develop() {
		System.out.println("I develop applications.");
		
	}

	@Override
	public void testApp() {
		System.out.println("Not my job.");
		
	}

	@Override
	public void deploy() {
		System.out.println("Not my job.");
		
	}

	@Override
	public void manageTeam() {
		System.out.println("Not my job.");
		
	}
	
}
```

Managers defines their job.
```java
class Manager implements Employee{

	@Override
	public void develop() {
		System.out.println("Not my job.");
		
	}

	@Override
	public void testApp() {
		System.out.println("Not my job.");
		
	}

	@Override
	public void deploy() {
		System.out.println("Not my job.");
		
	}

	@Override
	public void manageTeam() {
		System.out.println("Manage Team");
	}
	
}
```

**What's the problem in this code ?**
A manager or a developer are forced to implement other methods which not belongs to their role. Among all, even though only one is relevant to their position, they have to provide definition for other methods.

Let's fix this.

### Better Approach
Interface should be segregated in such extent that client should only need to implement relevant methods.

Segregated the interface into multiple interfaces
```java
interface AppDeveloper{
	void develop();
}
interface AppTester{
	void testApp();
}
interface TeamManager{
	void manageTeam();
}
```

Employees implemented only relevant jobs.
```java
class Developer implements AppDeveloper{

	@Override
	public void develop() {
		System.out.println("I develop applications.");
		
	}
}

class Manager implements TeamManager{

	public void manageTeam() {
		System.out.println("Manage Team");
	}
	
}
```

### Summary
Interfaces should have only relevant contracts so that a client should not need to provide details of irrelevant contract.
