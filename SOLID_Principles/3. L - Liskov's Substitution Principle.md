### Definition
Object reference of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclass without breaking the application.

Function that use reference to base classes must be able to use objects of the derived class without knowing it.

Introduced by Barbara Liskov in 1998.

**Avoid while using inheritance:**
* In an inheritance, process returning an object that's incompatible with the object returned by the superclass method.
* Throwing a new exception that's not thrown by the superclass method.
* Changing the semantics / extra validation which was not part of the contract while defining the superclass method.
### Problem Statement
Build an application in which any new subtype should not break the application. Let's say, the application which takes type of animals as input and let us know the behaviour of the animal. If a new animal is discovered and we pass that to the application should not break the application.

### Naive Approach

Animal interface having contract of fly, eat and sleep.
```java
interface Animal {
	void fly();
}
```

Class Bear implements all behaviour of Animal interface
```java
class Bear implements Animal{

	int speed;
	
	public Bear(int speed) {
		super();
		this.speed = speed;
	}

	@Override
	public void fly() {
		throw new RuntimeException("Bear cannot fly.");
	}
	
}
```

Class Pigeon also implements the Animal interface.
```java
class Pigeon implements Animal {

	int flyingSpeed;
	
	public Pigeon(int flyingSpeed) {
		super();
		this.flyingSpeed = flyingSpeed;
	}

	@Override
	public void fly() {
		System.out.printf("Pigeon is flying at %d km/hr.\n",flyingSpeed);
	}
	
}
```

KnowYourAnimal - Client class having this method which prints the behaviour of the animal.
```java
public class NoLiskov {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Animal pigeon = new Pigeon(20);
		Animal bear = new Bear(5);
		
		knowYourAnimal(pigeon);
		knowYourAnimal(bear);
	}
	
	public static void knowYourAnimal(Animal animal) {
		System.out.println("====== About " + animal.getClass().getSimpleName()+ "============");
		animal.fly();
	}
}
```

`Output:`
```java
====== About Pigeon============
Pigeon is flying at 20 km/hr.
====== About Bear============
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: Bear cannot fly.
	at com.techykumar29.Bear.fly(NoLiskov.java:34)
	at com.techykumar29.NoLiskov.knowYourAnimal(NoLiskov.java:15)
	at com.techykumar29.NoLiskov.main(NoLiskov.java:10)

```

**What's the problem in this code ?**  
First, instance of Pigeon class is passed to the knowYourAnimal method and it prints the behaviour of pigeon. Later, when we pass another type of animal to the same method it throws an exception that Bear cannot fly. 

We need to fix it so that an instance of any subtype should not break the application.
### Better Approach

```java
interface Animal {
	void move();
}


class Bear implements Animal {
	
	int speed;
	
	public Bear(int speed) {
		super();
		this.speed = speed;
	}

	@Override
	public void move() {
		System.out.printf("Bear runs at speed of %d km/hr.\n",speed );
	}

}

class Pigeon implements Animal {

	int flyingSpeed;
	
	public Pigeon(int flyingSpeed) {
		super();
		this.flyingSpeed = flyingSpeed;
	}

	@Override
	public void move() {
		System.out.printf("Pigeon is flying at %d km/hr.\n",flyingSpeed);
	}

}
```

KnowYourAnimal - Client class having this method which prints the behaviour of the animal.

```java
public class Liskov {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Animal pigeon = new Pigeon(20);
		Animal bear = new Bear(5);
		
		knowYourAnimal(pigeon);
		knowYourAnimal(bear);
	}
	
	public static void knowYourAnimal(Animal animal) {
		System.out.println("====== About " + animal.getClass().getSimpleName()+ "============");
		animal.move();
	}

}
```

`Output:`

```java
====== About Pigeon============
Pigeon is flying at 20 km/hr.
====== About Bear============
Bear runs at speed of 5 km/hr.
```

Now, use of any subclass instance of Animal interface doesn't break the application. 

### Summary

The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is a fundamental principle in object-oriented programming, particularly in the context of inheritance and polymorphism. It states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

`Note:` The above example is defined using inheritance.
