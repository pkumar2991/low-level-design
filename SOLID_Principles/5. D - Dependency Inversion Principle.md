### Definition
This principle states that classes should depend on abstraction (interfaces or abstract classes) rather than concrete implementation.

### Problem Statement
Let's say there are computers with various operating system. Build an app where we can get OS details irrespective of the OS types. In future we can have more different types OS available, so the app should be flexible to accommodate them without any change in existing code.

### Naive Approach

```java
interface OS{
	String getOS();
}
class Windows implements OS{

	@Override
	public String getOS() {
		return "Windows Operating System.";
	}
	
}
class Mac implements OS{

	@Override
	public String getOS() {
		return "Mac Operating System.";
	}
	
}
class OSManager {
	private Windows wos;
	
	public OSManager(Windows wos) {
		this.wos = wos;
	}
	
	public String getOSDetails() {
		return wos.getOS();
	}
}
```

Client class - Returns the OS details

```java
public class NoDependencyInversion {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		OSManager osm = new OSManager(new Windows());
		System.out.println(osm.getOSDetails());
	}
}
```

**What's the problem in this code ?**   
OSManager class is tightly coupled with Windows class. It means this can deal with only Windows OS. We need to have OS specific Manager class to handle them separately. Here, code is written based on concrete class rather on interfaces or abstraction.

Let's fix this.

### Better Approach

Dependency Inversion principle suggests us to write code on interfaces rather on concrete classes.

```java
interface OS {
	String getOS();
}
class Windows implements OS {

	@Override
	public String getOS() {
		return "Windows Operating System.";
	}

}
class Mac implements OS {

	@Override
	public String getOS() {
		return "Mac Operating System.";
	}

}
```

OSManager class depends on interface rather on concrete class.

```java
class OSManager {
	private OS os;

	public OSManager(OS os) {
		this.os = os;
	}

	public String getOSDetails() {
		return os.getOS();
	}
}
```

Client class
```java
public class DependencyInversionPrinciple {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		OSManager osm = new OSManager(new Mac());
		System.out.println(osm.getOSDetails());
		osm = new OSManager(new Windows());
		System.out.println(osm.getOSDetails());
}
```

OSManager can handle any type of operating systems which implements OS interface.

### Summary
The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design. It states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details; rather, details should depend on abstractions.
